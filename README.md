[Running Meeting Note](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wip-kDJHyLVldHFIrES-p2NLOI2Qk7_ww8qfhiIvoc4/edit?usp=sharing)

## Milestones
1. Four hours per day work:
2. Milestones:
    - `Dec 2, 2024` Start doing writeup
    - `Dec 1, 2024` Finish project
    - `Nov 30, 2024` Basemodel, can be bad models, ready to fine tune.
    - `Nov 28, 2024` EDA all finish, start doing model(EDA简单粗暴)
        - Prioritize cleaning and standardization
        - Dataset can use Hawaii if no choice
        - After this, everyone focus on modeling
    - `Nov 26, 2024` Model 1 & 2 start (Jason & Kevin), make sure not just mathematically, but practically work.
    - `Nov 25, 2024` Data cleaning finish (at least good dat, doesn’t need to be best data)
        - Have a Python file with clean code that preprocesses and give clean data

## Assignment Requirements
